## Bugs
    - [original] Key shortcuts not working when canvas is not mouse-over.
        in spaint normal: perfect
        in spaint pro: break on mouse not over
        in pchat366 both: break everytime, have to click canvas to regain
    - [original?] Repaint of varying quality with flashing(zoom spam)
        in spaint normal: just scrollbars
        in spaint pro: scrollbars and canvas
        in pchat366 both: whole UI
        in PaintBBS scrollbar may appear garbled when moving over bars and buttons (JRE1.8)
    - [decompile] The whole sourcecode is hot, piping mess after decompile
    - [original] The whole sourcecode was hot, piping mess, before it was compiled
