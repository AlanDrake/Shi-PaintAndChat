        in pchat366 both: break everytime, have to click canvas to regain
    - [original?] Repaint of varying quality with flashing(zoom spam)
        in spaint normal: just scrollbars
        in spaint pro: scrollbars and canvas
        in pchat366 both: whole UI
    - [decompile] The whole sourcecode is hot, piping mess after decompile
